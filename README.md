# Deploying a Node Js Application on AWS EC2

### Testing the project locally

1. Clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/verma-kunal/AWS-Session.git
```
2. Setup the following environment variables - `(.env)` file
```
DOMAIN= ""
PORT=3000
STATIC_DIR="./client"

PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""
SECRET_KEY=""
```
3. Initialise and start the project
```
npm install
npm run start
```

### Set up an AWS EC2 instance

1. Create an IAM user & login to your AWS Console
    - Access Type - Password
    - Permissions - Admin
2. Create an EC2 instance
    - Select an OS image - Ubuntu
    - Create a new key pair & download `.pem` file
    - Instance type - t2.micro
3. Connecting to the instance using ssh
```
ssh -i instance.pem ubunutu@<IP_ADDRESS>
```

### Configuring Ubuntu on remote VM

1. Updating the outdated packages and dependencies
```
sudo apt update
```
3. Install Git - [Guide by DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-22-04) 
4. Configure Node.js and `npm` - [Guide by DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04)

### Deploying the project on AWS

1. Clone this project in the remote VM
```
git clone https://github.com/verma-kunal/AWS-Session.git
```
2. Setup the following environment variables - `(.env)` file
```
DOMAIN= ""
PORT=3000
STATIC_DIR="./client"

PUBLISHABLE_KEY=""
SECRET_KEY=""
```
> For this project, we'll have to set up an [Elastic IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) for our EC2 & that would be our `DOMAIN`

3. Initialise and start the project
```
npm install
npm run start
```

> NOTE - We will have to edit the **inbound rules** in the security group of our EC2, in order to allow traffic from our particular port

### Project is deployed on AWS ðŸŽ‰



**Stripe Payment Setup for the Project**

Step 1
Create a new account on Stripe and login to the dashboard.
Step 2
Once logged-in, make sure the Test Mode is on before moving forward with the next steps. That way, you wonâ€™t need to worry about any credit cards, payments etc. as we are just using this for development purposes.



Step 3
Head over to the Developers tab. (It is visible in the image above, besides the Test Mode toggle)


Step 4
In the Developers section, head over to the API Keys tab and there youâ€™ll find your test publishable & secret api key that you can use with the project.
Again, make sure the test data toggle is switched on.


__________________________________________
Only required if you are creating new publishable & secret keys!!
Alright, in order to view the actual stripe payment page for the workshops (when you run the website locally), youâ€™ll need to create new products in the Stripe dashboard.

Step 1
Head over the products tab on the dashboard and click on Add product




Step 2
Add the required product info. Name, Price, Description (optional). Make sure you select the one time option as shown below and click on Save product.


Step 3
On the next page, youâ€™ll be able to see all the details for your product. The important thing over here is the API ID that we need, which weâ€™ll input in our code.

Here is the file from the original source code that shows where this product api id would go!



So, the logic is, 1 product per workshop and according to that, you can create 2 more products in Stripe dashboard and input in there IDs to other workshop html files. (similar to the above process).

Hope this makes things clear & now you are able to use Stripe payment with your app!
